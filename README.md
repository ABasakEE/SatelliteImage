# SatelliteImage
 SoC project 2024

 In this project, we will learn the tools needed to convert satellite images into maps. On our jounery, we started with some basic tools of classification like Principal Component Analysis, regression techniques, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Bayesian classification and Support Vector Machines. 
 The working of these methods, as well as their associated implementations in scikit-learn, have been explored in the iris.ipynb file. The other .ipynb files were example notebooks sent to us by our mentor to get an idea about how to implement different classification techniques in Python.
